# grid-fibonacci-game


 
This app is a Fibonacci game on a table. You should on each that you want and you can create a Fibonacci pattern.
When you click on each cell you should expect to see the cell increase the number by 1 and change the background color to Yellow.
If you find 5 successful Fibonacci patterns, the cells' backgrounds will change to Green, then after 2 seconds they will be empty and will change to 0.
